Is there a specific order in which Maths Optional Syllabus should be covered?
The Mathematics optional syllabus, like all other optional subjects, is divided into two papers, further bifurcated into two sections each. The preparation, however, must not be done paperwise or sectionwise. The best strategy is to remember which topics should be done consecutively or at least in the vicinity of the other. You may start from any topic, but the following combinations must be adhered to. One must do Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) and Partial Differential Equations (PDE) in sync with each other. Not only is there a link between the two conceptually, but there is also overlap in terms of some methods. Moreover, the book is also common (Ordinary and partial differential equations by MD Raisinghnaia).

Next, one must always prepare Real Analysis and Calculus simultaneously. This is imperative also from the point of view of the UPSC Maths syllabus as there are some topics like Riemann integration or improper integrals, which are covered in both. Linear Algebra, especially the vector spaces portion, must be tuned with Abstract algebra as a sound clarity about properties of groups and rings (specifically fields) helps to do theorems in a more logical and structured manner.

Then, one must keep in mind to do Vector calculus before doing the Physics topics as it forms the backbone of the same. Complex Analysis similarly must be done after real analysis. Even though some topics like Gauss elimination, Gauss Seidel etc. are more or less covered in Linear Algebra, Numerical Analysis may be done independently. Likewise, linear programming can also be done more or less without support from other topics, though it is preferable to do both after linear algebra. Since 3-dimensional geometry is also not required in-depth for others, Analytic geometry may be done without keeping any order in mind.

FAQs on UPSC Maths Optional Syllabus
What is the duration in which Maths optional syllabus can be effectively covered?
One of the biggest advantages of mathematics optional is its static syllabus. Hence, once properly covered, repetitive revisions with some enhancements are the best way to strengthen the optional. The first round, or foundation-level preparation, is the longest period, stretching to close to 6-6.5 months. Thereafter, the second revision can be done in half the time, which is advised till before prelims. The third revision is to be corroborated with writing tests, which completes one full cycle of revision effective for writing mains.

Is Maths a Good Optional Subject?
Mathematics has consistently remained a high-scoring subject, whether in UPSC exams or any other examination. With thorough preparation and accurate answer writing, achieving high marks becomes a highly probable outcome.

Is there any step marks in the UPSC Maths Optional Paper?
Yes, there is step marking in the optional Mathematics paper of the UPSC CSE examination. Candidates may lose marks if they skip an important step while solving a problem. Also, in theorems/theoretical questions, marks are given for attempting it upto a certain level. Moreover, if the answer does not match completely in a numerical question, then depending upon the presentation and stage at which a mistake has occurred, some marks are allotted if the student has written the solution in steps.
